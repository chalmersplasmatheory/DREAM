Introduction
============
The **Disruption Runaway Electron Avoidance Model** DREAM is designed to
simulate runaway electron generation during a tokamak disruption.

For users
---------
If you would like to run simulations with DREAM, you should have a look at the
documentation of the :ref:`python-frontend`.

For developers
--------------
If you are trying to understand how DREAM works a deeper level, you are most
likely interested in the documentation for the :ref:`cpp-kernel`.

For physicists
--------------
If you are curious about the physical model implemented in DREAM, you should
have a look at the physics notes located under
`doc/notes/ <https://github.com/chalmersplasmatheory/DREAM/tree/master/doc/notes>`_
in the DREAM git repository.
