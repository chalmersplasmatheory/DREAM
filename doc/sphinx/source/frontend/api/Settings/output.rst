Output
======
The settings described on this page regulate the name and very specific content
of the output file generated by DREAM.

File name
---------
At the end of a simulation, DREAM will save data from the simulation to an
output file. By default, this file is named ``output.h5`` and is created
right before DREAM exits. The user can specify a custom name for the output
file by calling the ``setFilename()`` method on the ``Output`` object of the
``DREAMSettings`` object:

.. code-block:: python

   ds = DREAMSettings()
   ...
   ds.output.setFilename("custom-output-filename.h5")

Timing information
------------------
DREAM automatically monitors the execution time of certain critical parts of
the simulation. Information about the execution time can be output to ``stdout``
at the end of a successfull simulation, and can also be stored in the final
output file.

Measurement of execution time is regulated by the ``setTiming()`` method which
takes two booleans as arguments: ``stdout``, whether details about execution 
time should be printed to ``stdout`` at the end of the simulation, and ``file``,
whether the details should be stored in the final output file generated.

.. code-block:: python

   ds = DREAMSettings()
   ...
   # Print timing info to stdout AND store in output file
   ds.output.setTiming(stdout=True, file=True)

By default, no timing information is created.


.. tip::

   Simulation output will generally be stored even if DREAM crashes. The named
   output file will then be created (or overwritten if it already exists) and
   contain data from all time steps that finished successfully. The data file
   can be loaded as usual with the DREAM Python output interface.
