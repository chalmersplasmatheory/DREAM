  CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE      -- For in/excluding debug symbols. Possible values are "Debug" and "Release".
  
VALGRIND
  memcheck (default)    -- Find memory leaks and errors
    
    --log-file=FILENAME         Store valgrind output to the specified file
    --leak-check=yes            Look for memory leaks
    --num-callers=N             Keep 'N' lines of info in call stacks
    --track-origins=yes         Keep track of where uninitialized values were allocated

  callgrind             -- Profiling
    
    [Use 'kcachegrind' for visualizing output]

  massif                -- Log calls to 'malloc()' and friends

    [Use 'massif-visualizer' for visualizing output]


GDB

  catch [event]    -- Stop when event occurs. It can be any of
    throw             Throwing of a C++ exception
    catch             Catching of a C++ exception
    (and a few more which are irrelevant)
  tcatch [event]   -- Same as catch, but removed after first catch
